    <h3>About the Nail Technician</h3>
    <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated nail technician who believes that
        nails are a powerful form of self-expression. My journey began with
        a love for beauty, creativity, and precision.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I have developed
        strong skills in nail care, nail art, and modern enhancement techniques.
        Every client receives personalized attention to ensure comfort, hygiene,
        and satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to create a welcoming space where clients feel confident,
        relaxed, and beautiful. Every nail set is created with care, creativity,
        and professionalism.
